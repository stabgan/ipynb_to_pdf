`ipynb_to_pdf` is a desktop application developed using Python and PyQt5 to convert multiple Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) files to PDF. You can select the extraction location, making the conversion process simple and efficient.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the application running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```
python3 --version
```
<b>P.s. I have used v3.11 but it will probably work with older versions of python also.</b>

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/stabgan/ipynb_to_pdf.git
```
Navigate to the cloned repository:
```
cd ipynb_to_pdf
```
Run the shell script ipynb_to_pdf.sh:
```
./ipynb_to_pdf.sh
```
The shell script will handle the creation and activation of the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies, and run the application.
You can create a shortcut of this .sh script to your desktop, and use it as a desktop application

### Usage

After running ipynb_to_pdf.sh, the application will launch. You can then select multiple .ipynb files that you wish to convert to PDF and choose the desired location for the converted files.
